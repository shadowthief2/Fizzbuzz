# Fizzbuzz
This is a simple counting game where players take turns saying numbers in sequence. Every time someone reaches a multiple of 3, they must say "Fizz", and, for multiples of 5, "Buzz". Numbers that are multiples of both are "Fizzbuzz". This simple game is challenging on its own, as one must remember which numbers are multiples of which other numbers. However, it can also be expanded by including extra words for extra prime numbers. 7 becomes "Bizz", 11 becomes "Fuzz", 13 "Wizz", 17 "Wuzz", etc.

Because it's so simple, there are a multitude of ways to program something like this, making it an excellent way to demonstrate one's particular style of programming. It's not a common programming test, but it's certainly reliable, and it's always good to know about.

This particular one is the one I made, written in the way that I like to code. It's about three or four iterations in, but it's short, elegant, and can be expanded ad absurdum, provided one can come up with enough words to replace primes.
